# TOOLS

`pullConsumer.js` is a simple script that demonstrates connecting to a stream and consuming events/messages. Default configuration is connecting to localhost CHEFS stream, as defined in `.devcontainer/localhost/jetstream.conf and running in this devcontainer. You can run against other streams by setting environment variables. See comments in the [code](./pullConsumer.js) for more information.
