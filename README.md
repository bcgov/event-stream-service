# event-stream-service

lots to do...

for developers: run in the devcontainer.

launch "app: serve"
launch "frontend: dev"

and that will bring up the server (app) on 8080 and the frontend on 5173.

you can then launch "frontend: chrome" if you want to debug the frontend code (it sometimes takes a second launch to get it working.).

default configuration is to use Standard Realm SSO dev values.
